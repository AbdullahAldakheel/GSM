## Introduction


One of the goals of the 2030 vision, the government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is
going to match the local oil prices with the global prices. Hence, we will be creating a system to
help the government monitor and update the prices according to the global prices. Therefore, the
system will solve the issue of having different prices at each gas station. This system will match
local prices to the world prices. This solves any issues of having to manually monitor and
manually update the prices. This will make it easier for the worker and the customer.

## Methodology


We are going to use the prototyping methodology because our requirements are unclear
and therefore, we will be creating prototypes. These prototypes will help us detect errors early
also it will aid us developers in grasping the idea as a whole and the customer can give us
feedback per each prototype. We will go through three main phases; analysis, design and
implementation. The analysis phase will take us around a week. Design will take more than two
months and implementation will take a bit more than six months. There will be five subsystems.
A tracking system that will be configured to stay updated to the global prices. The pricing system
that will also monitor the sale prices. The send and receive system will be installed to help in
organizing and adding an extra layer for security purposes. There will also be an application
system for the regular user (person who uses the gas station) to allow him to report any mismatch
in prices and it includes maps for the nearby gas stations. Finally, a fining system that will help
administrators issue fines and let gas stations view these fines. This will be connected to the
reportsâ€™ database which will be sent to the ministry of commerce and investment.
