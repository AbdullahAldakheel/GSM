## Introduction


•	Web application for gestations to monitor the prices built with Laravel framework, JavaScript and hosted on shared hosting https://gsm.ahdakh.com/.

•	Guests can send complaints about gas station price manipulation.

•	Users (gas stations) can view and confirm recent prices released by Admin.


## Methodology


A tracking system that will be configured to stay updated to the global prices. The pricing system that will also monitor the sale prices. The send and receive system will be installed to help in organizing and adding an extra layer for security purposes. There will also be an application system for the regular user (person who uses the gas station) to allow him to report any mismatch in prices and it includes maps for the nearby gas stations. Finally, a fining system that will help administrators issue fines and let gas stations view these fines.
